# Note on usage of the python scripts

1. DB_HDF5

    - These scripts convert SQLite database files to HDF5 files.
    - There are two versions of the script currently, each having a slightly different functionalty.
        a. The script "db_hdf5_v1.py" creates HDF5 files from corresponding SQLite db files in many-to-one fashion. So, for all db files present in one input folder, one equivalent HDF5 file is created in the output folder. For input folders containing more hierarchies, one HDF5 file is created for contents of each subfolder.
        b. The script "db_hdf5_v2.py"ncreates HDF5 files from corresponding SQLite db files in one-to-one fashion. So, for each db file present in the input folder, equivalent HDF5 file is created in the output folder. To combine db files into a single HDF5 file , use version 1 of script named db_hdf5_v1.py instead.
    - The script is refactored for Python3. Any help regarding the execution of the script can be obtained by using the following command in any terminal window:
        - python3 db_hdf5_v1.py -h
        - python3 db_hdf5_v2.py -h
    - There is an option to pass-in a desired output folder for the output.
    - Alternatively, by default the output is either created in the folder containing the script, or in the same folder that has the input folder. You can adjust the default option for output by commenting out the appropriate line in the script. Please look for the section "Set output parameters" in the script and comment out the option that you do not prefer. Currently, it is set such that the output folder is created in the folder containing the input folder by default.

## Note: There is no difference in the size of combined HDF5 (many-to-one generated by db_hdf5_v1.py) and separate HDF5 (one-to-one generated by db_hdf5_v2.py) files, even when compressing. However, separate HDF5 files are easier to manipulate when restructuring the HDF5 into files per Agent-type (i.e. Bank.h5, Eurostat.h5 and so on). Therefore, use of db_hdf5_v2.py is recommended for simplicity.

2. XML_HDF5

    - This script converts XML files to HDF5 files.
    - This script creates HDF5 files from corresponding XML files in many-to-one fashion. So, for all xml files present in one input folder, one equivalent HDF5 file is created in the output folder. For input folders containing more hierarchies, one HDF5 file is created for contents of each subfolder.
    - The script runs on Python2. Any help regarding the execution of the script can be obtained by using the following command in any terminal window:
        - python xml_hdf5.py -h
    - There is an option to pass-in a desired output folder for the output.
    - Alternatively, by default the output is either created in the folder containing the script, or in the same folder that has the input folder. You can adjust the default option for output by commenting out the appropriate line in the script. Please look for the section "Set output parameters" in the script and comment out the option that you do not prefer. Currently, it is set such that the output folder is created in the folder containing the input folder by default.

3. DB_XML

    - This script converts SQlite Db files to XML files.
    - This script creates XML files from corresponding DB files in one-to-many fashion. For each DB file, a folder is created and multiple corresponding XML files are created inside the folder, based on time samples.
    - The script runs on Python2. Any help regarding the execution of the script can be obtained by using the following command in any terminal window:
        - python genxml.py -h
    - There is an option to pass-in a desired output folder for the output.
    - Alternatively, by default the output is either created in the folder containing the script, or in the same folder that has the input folder. You can adjust the default option for output by commenting out the appropriate line in the script. Please look for the section "Set output parameters" in the script and comment out the option that you do not prefer. Currently, it is set such that the output folder is created in the folder containing the input folder by default.
